Hello,

My name is Ayush. I am 19 years old. I received a Google Foobar invite when I was 17 and have been working in startups since the 11th grade. I coded neural networks from scratch at 18 and am currently an ML & iOS engineer at [focusbear.io](http://focusbear.io). I am also highly active on Twitter ([@ayushy_](https://www.twitter.com/ayushy_)). Learn about my previous experiences on my LinkedIn ([Ayush K](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayush-k-75b379223/)).
